\chapter{PROPOSED SOLUTION}
\label{chap:caseMedical}

This chapter describes the team's solution overview and details of each component. In the overview, this report briefly describe the system as a whole. There are two main components in the system: A crowd-sourcing system and two classifier systems. The crowd-sourcing system collect data from users by crowd-sourcing methods. The classifier system does two jobs:  face recognition and video classification.
\section{Overview of the system}
\section{Crowd-sourcing system}
\section{Analysis systems}
The project requires two systems for analysis: A face recognition system and a video classifier system. The facial recognition system takes pictures of human faces as input and return their identification. The video classifier system analyzes videos to find out actions in them. The remaining of this section describes in detail about the two analysis system.
