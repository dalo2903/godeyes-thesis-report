\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT}

\section{Accomplishment}
Through the development of this thesis, the following accomplishments are achieved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Research and propose a model for analyzing video data. The problem of analyzing videos is treated as a video classification problem. This thesis proposes using a model containing a pretrained CNN for features extraction followed by LSTMs for sequence prediction and had moderate success.
    \item Build a system to collect data using the crowdsourcing model. This system has the form of a social media website. This website allows users to interact with each other and contribute labels to create labeled data for other purposes.
    \item Develop a UI to interact with users using modern HTML5. This UI support many platforms such as mobile and desktop.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Limitation}
There are some limitation to be improved upon:

\begin{enumerate}

\item There is not enough real data to train and test the video classification model so it cannot be used to classify real data yet.
\end{enumerate}
