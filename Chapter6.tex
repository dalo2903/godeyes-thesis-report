\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT}

\section{Accomplishment}
Through the development of this thesis, the following accomplishments are achieved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Research and propose a model for analyzing video data. The problem of analyzing videos is treated as a video classification problem. This thesis proposes using a model containing a pretrained CNN for features extraction followed by LSTMs for sequence prediction and had moderate success.
    \item Build a system to collect data using the crowdsourcing model. This system has the form of a social media website. This website allows users to interact with each other and contribute labels to create labeled data for other purposes.
    \item Develop a UI to interact with users using modern HTML5. This UI support many platforms such as mobile and desktop.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Limitation}
\subsection{Social media website}
There are some limitation to be improved upon:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Current way of deciding final label for a video is too simple.
\item There is no method to attract users and encourage users to label yet.
\item The system has a small number of users, so there are potential bugs to be undiscovered.
 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Data analysis modules}
\begin{enumerate}

\item There is not enough real data to train and test the video classification model so it cannot be used to classify real data yet.
\item Facial recognition depend on third-party services.Therefore, the system relies on those services.

\end{enumerate}
\section{Further development}
To fix above short-comings, some of the following improvements are proposed:
\subsection{Social media website}\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementing a rewarding system to attract users and encourage users to label video. Users earn points by creating posts and labeling video. Points are used to exchanged for rewards such as voucher, gift card, ...
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Data analysis modules}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Build a facial recognition system using Deep learning models so that the system become self sustained.
\end{enumerate}
