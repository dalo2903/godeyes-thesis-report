\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT}

\section{Accomplishment}
Through the development of this thesis, the following accomplishments are achieved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Research and propose a model for analyzing video data. The problem of analyzing videos is treated as a video classification problem. This thesis proposes using a model containing a pretrained CNN for features extraction followed by LSTMs for sequence prediction and had moderate success.
    \item Build a system to collect data using the crowdsourcing model. This system has the form of a social media website. This website allows users to interact with each other and contribute labels to create labeled data for other purposes.
    \item Develop a UI to interact with users using modern HTML5. This UI support many platforms such as mobile and desktop.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Limitation}
There are some limitation to be improved upon:

\begin{enumerate}

\item There is not enough real data to train and test the video classification model so it cannot be used to classify real data yet.
\item Many features such as authentication and facial recognition depend on third-party services, creating a reliance on the system to those services.
\item The system has a small user base, so there are not many test case yet, which causes potential bugs to be undiscovered.
 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Further development}
To fix above short-comings, some of the following improvements are proposed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run the system at a small scale to collect more data and user experience.
\item Build a facial recognition system using Deep learning models so that the system become self sustained.
\end{enumerate}
